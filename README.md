# Qwork: A Simple PHP Framework

There are already a lot of PHP frameworks out there.  The difference here is that I didn't write any of the other ones.

## Why another framework?

I have been writing PHP code for several years and never bothered to use one of the existing frameworks.  Looking at some of the popular ones I decided that I didn't like the way they worked.  Some seem bloated, while others lack documentation.  I hope to bridge the gap and build an easy to use framework that isn't lacking on documentation and examples.

Oh, and I am bored and wanted a new project to work on.

## Goals

The main goal is to provide a framework that simplifies the creation of web based applications, without making it hard to learn.  Other frameworks can seem like a new language.  Using this framework should still feel like writing PHP.

## Work in progress

There is a lot of work that is still needed.  All feedback is welcome!

* Rough draft of the logic behind rendering views is in place.  It isn't really flexible yet.

## Documentation

Since GitHub offers a wiki, [I'm going to use it](https://github.com/mrhazel/Qwork/wiki) 

## Known Issues

Considering that there isn't much going on yet, anything that hasn't been implemented can be considered a known 'issue.'  If you find a bug/issue, please let me know.  

## TODO

* Documentation
	* Actually use the wiki provided by GitHub.
	* Not focusing on until more functionality is in place.
	* Need to add some docblocks and then generate PHPDoc documentation.
	* Put together examples
* Write tests
* Refactor all the things.
